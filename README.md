I want to analyze the master game database to exctract features of particular chess openings
My goal is to extract features about individual pieces to understand which pieces are most active in which types of games. games could be classified by length, complexity, score, etc.
Games are recorded in PGN (Portable Game Notation) a plaintext file format. (more at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation).
